**Task-1 focuses on API integration and data visualization using Python and is designed to help students gain hands-on experience with real-world data processing. This task requires students to fetch live data from a public API—such as OpenWeatherMap—by using Python’s requests library to send HTTP GET requests and retrieve the response in JSON format. Once the data is fetched, it is processed using the pandas library, which structures the raw data into a DataFrame format suitable for analysis. The next step involves creating visualizations using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn. Matplotlib is a versatile plotting library for Python that enables the creation of various types of graphs such as bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts. Seaborn, built on top of matplotlib, simplifies statistical plotting with attractive default styles and functions for complex visualizations like heatmaps, boxplots, and regression charts. To complete this task, students are expected to build a basic visualization dashboard that displays different charts related to the dataset they chose, such as temperature trends, humidity patterns, or other time-based insights.

The entire coding and visualization work is to be carried out in the Spyder IDE (Scientific Python Development Environment). Spyder is especially suited for data science and analytics because it includes features such as an interactive IPython console, a variable explorer to monitor data in real time, and built-in plotting windows to instantly view graphs. Its user-friendly interface makes it perfect for beginners who are new to data science. Spyder helps students write, debug, and run Python scripts efficiently while offering a MATLAB-like experience. Students will be delivering a .py script that includes their code for API integration and visualization, along with snapshots or PDF exports of their final dashboard output.

This task not only strengthens foundational Python skills but also introduces key data science practices, making it highly applicable in a wide range of real-world domains. For example, in weather monitoring systems, similar scripts can be used to fetch real-time atmospheric data and display trends over time for different cities. In financial analysis, APIs from stock markets or cryptocurrency exchanges can be integrated to visualize market movements and trends. In IoT applications, sensor data can be pulled from cloud platforms and shown on live dashboards. In healthcare analytics, COVID-19 data or patient statistics can be visualized to track infections, recoveries, or resource needs. In agriculture, farmers can use real-time weather APIs to plan irrigation or crop selection based on temperature and rainfall forecasts. Even in e-commerce, product pricing or review trends from platforms like Amazon can be visualized to aid consumer behavior research. Overall, Task-1 provides practical experience in working with APIs, real-time data, and visualization techniques, all of which are essential skills for careers in data analysis, machine learning, business intelligence, and software development. This mini-project can be showcased in resumes, college projects, or personal portfolios as a demonstration of data handling and presentation skills in Python using the Spyder IDE.**
